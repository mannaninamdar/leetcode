# 🧮 LeetCode Practice Journey

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems as I learn and grow as a problem solver.

## 📌 Purpose

- To practice **data structures and algorithms**
- To build a consistent habit of problem solving
- To track my **progress** and **learning notes**

## 📂 Structure

Each folder or file contains:

- ✅ The **problem name**
- 🧪 My **code solution** (mostly in JavaScript or Typescritp)
- 📝 Optional **comments or explanations** where needed

# Wish me Luck! 🌝
